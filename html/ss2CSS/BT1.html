  <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
  <p class="xanh">
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to gormat the layout of a webpage.
  </p>
  <p id="do">
    With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing
    between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, that backgroud
    images or backgroud colors are to be used, different displays for different
    devices and screen sizes, and much more!

    <b>Tip:</b> The word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent
    element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. So, if
    you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and
    other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you
    specify something else)!
